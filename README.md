# Reinforcement-Learning

This project simulates and optimizes a call center environment using reinforcement learning techniques. Below is a description of each file and folder:

- **`CallCentreEnvironment.py`**  
  Defines the **environment** of the call center. This script includes the simulation logic, state and action definitions, and reward mechanisms used for training and evaluation.

- **`CallCentreProject.ipynb`**  
  Contains the **operational code** for the project. This notebook demonstrates:
  - Simulation and interaction with the call center environment.
  - Implementation of **Value Iteration** for model-based optimization.
  - Application of **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)** for model-free reinforcement learning.

- **`Project_Data/`**  
  A folder that **stores model outputs and simulation results**, such as:
  - Trained RL models
  - Evaluation metrics
